## Context

Many clusters contain different types of nodes and devices. Examples are bare-metal nodes and virtual machines, Slurm
nodes and Kubernetes nodes, different GPU models, and accelerators that are not GPUs. Operators must set a different
behaviour for each group ([#1903](https://github.com/NVIDIA/NVSentinel/issues/1903),
[#1904](https://github.com/NVIDIA/NVSentinel/issues/1904)). Typical cases are:

1. The operator enables automated remediation for one group of nodes and monitors the results. Then the operator
   enables it for more groups.
2. NVSentinel drains a group of nodes, and an external system repairs them
   ([ADR-040](040-external-remediation-request.md)).
3. NVSentinel resets bare-metal nodes and replaces virtual machines.
4. NVSentinel drains Slurm nodes with a drain plugin and drains all other nodes with the eviction API
   ([#1857](https://github.com/NVIDIA/NVSentinel/issues/1857)).
5. NVSentinel reboots the node after a fault on one device type or GPU model, but not after a fault on a different one.
6. A group of nodes only gets monitoring, or only gets monitoring and a quarantine.

Each component that acts on a fault already reads the node, and two of them can already select by node:

| Stage | Control for each node at this time | Limitation |
|---|---|---|
| platform-connectors | `managed=false` changes events to `STORE_ONLY`. Override rules ([ADR-021](021-health-event-property-overrides.md)) can change `recommendedAction` | `STORE_ONLY` also stops node conditions. Override rules read node labels from a cache that can be 10 minutes old, skip a rule that fails, and change the event for all later stages |
| fault-quarantine | CEL `Node` and `HealthEvent` rules in each rule set ([ADR-003](003-rule-based-node-quarantine.md)) | Complete for the first event on a node. A later event on a quarantined node applies only its labels, not its taints or cordon ([#1439](https://github.com/NVIDIA/NVSentinel/issues/1439)) |
| node-drainer | `customDrain.nodeSelector` ([#1871](https://github.com/NVIDIA/NVSentinel/pull/1871)) and `podDrainPolicies` ([pod label drain policies ADR](055-pod-drain-policies.md)) | Cannot skip the drain for a group. Checks the selector again on each pass, so a label change during a drain can change the drain method. Records the method only in a log |
| fault-remediation | None | One map from action to CR applies to the full cluster. An action that is not in the map is recorded as `remediation-failed` |

Thus, case 4 and most of case 6 work at this time. The gap is mostly in fault-remediation, which has no selection,
and in the event, which does not identify the device model.

[ADR-060](https://github.com/NVIDIA/NVSentinel/pull/1952) proposed one shared behaviour profile that all three
components read. This ADR replaces it. It adds the missing controls to each component, in the configuration and the
selection syntax that each component already uses.

## Decision

1. **Each component keeps its own configuration and selection syntax.** There is no shared profile and no shared
   package for group definitions.
2. **fault-quarantine:** no new configuration. A later event on a quarantined node applies the taints and the cordon
   of the rule sets that it matches ([#1439](https://github.com/NVIDIA/NVSentinel/issues/1439)). This ADR requires that
   fix.
3. **node-drainer:**
   - Add `skipDrain.nodeSelector`. A node that matches is not drained. It stays in quarantine and is not remediated.
   - Select the drain method one time, when the drain for an event starts. Record the method and the scope on the
     event status.
4. **fault-remediation:** add `maintenance.rules`. This is an ordered list of CEL rules on `node` and `event`.
   - The first rule that matches selects a different action from `maintenance.actions`, or disables remediation.
   - fault-remediation evaluates the rules immediately before it creates the CR, with the Node that it already reads.
   - It records the rule and the action on the event status.
   - A disabled remediation is recorded as `remediation-skipped`, not `remediation-failed`.
5. **Health events identify the device model and architecture.** Each impacted entity can carry these as attributes.
   Rules in fault-quarantine and fault-remediation can then select a GPU model or a device type.

| Case | Configuration |
|---|---|
| 1. Staged rollout | fault-remediation rule: `disabled` for nodes that are not in the wave |
| 2. External repair | fault-remediation rule: an action entry for an `ExternalRemediationRequest` |
| 3. Reset bare metal, replace VMs | fault-remediation rule: `COMPONENT_RESET` on VM nodes selects a `TerminateNode` entry |
| 4. Slurm drain plugin | `customDrain.nodeSelector`, at this time |
| 5. Device type or model | fault-remediation rule, or fault-quarantine rule set, on `event.componentClass` or entity attributes |
| 6. Monitoring only | fault-quarantine rule sets whose `Node` rule excludes the group, at this time |
| 6. Monitoring and quarantine | node-drainer `skipDrain.nodeSelector` |

## Implementation

### fault-quarantine

The configuration does not change. The rule sets already select by node labels and by event fields. All rule sets
that match apply, and `priority` resolves label conflicts. The cordon-reason label lists the rule sets that matched.
A rule set that cannot be evaluated does not match, and a metric counts the error.

The fix for [#1439](https://github.com/NVIDIA/NVSentinel/issues/1439) is a prerequisite:

- When a later unhealthy event on a quarantined node matches a rule set, fault-quarantine applies the taints and the
  cordon of that rule set, and adds the rule set to the cordon-reason label.
- When an event recovers, fault-quarantine removes only the taints that no remaining event needs.

**Monitoring only.** An operator excludes a group from quarantine with a `Node` rule, for example
`!(node.labels["example.com/pool"] in ["legacy-a", "legacy-b"])`. Health events and node conditions continue for
these nodes. No later stage runs, because node-drainer starts only for a quarantined node.

### node-drainer

```yaml
skipDrain:
  # Nodes that match are not drained. Same syntax as customDrain.nodeSelector.
  # Empty: no node is skipped.
  nodeSelector: "example.com/pool in (quarantine-only)"
customDrain:
  enabled: true
  nodeSelector: "scheduler=slurm"
```

**One decision for each event.** Before node-drainer evicts the first pod or creates the custom drain CR for an event,
it selects the drain method with the node labels from its node informer:

1. `drainOverrides` on the event apply first, as they do at this time.
2. If the node matches `skipDrain.nodeSelector`, the method is `Skip`.
3. If custom drain is enabled and the node matches `customDrain.nodeSelector`, the method is `Custom`.
4. Otherwise, the method is `Evict`.

node-drainer records the method and the drain scope (`Node`, or the entity for a partial drain) on the event status
before it acts. Later passes for the same event read the record and do not check the selectors again. Thus, a label
change during a drain does not change the method. A cold start reads the record.

**Skip.** node-drainer records `userPodsEvictionStatus: Skipped` and the node state `drain-skipped`. `Skipped` is
different from `AlreadyDrained`. fault-remediation starts only for `Succeeded` and `AlreadyDrained`, so it does not
start for this event. The node stays in quarantine until the event recovers or the operator cancels it.

The recorded scope also replaces the configuration that
[#1960](https://github.com/NVIDIA/NVSentinel/pull/1960) copies into fault-quarantine to find out if a drain was
partial.

The node informer already keeps the label keys that `customDrain.nodeSelector` reads. It also keeps the keys of
`skipDrain.nodeSelector`.

### fault-remediation

```yaml
maintenance:
  actions:
    COMPONENT_RESET: { kind: RebootNode, ... }       # unchanged
    REPLACE_VM: { kind: TerminateNode, ... }         # unchanged
    EXTERNAL_REPAIR: { kind: ExternalRemediationRequest, ... }
  rules:                                             # ordered; the first match wins
    - name: lpu-no-remediation
      expression: 'event.componentClass == "LPU"'
      disabled: true
    - name: outside-rollout
      expression: '!("example.com/remediation-wave" in node.labels) || node.labels["example.com/remediation-wave"] != "1"'
      disabled: true
    - name: vm-replace
      expression: 'node.labels["example.com/platform"] == "vm" && event.recommendedAction == "COMPONENT_RESET"'
      action: REPLACE_VM
    - name: partner-repair
      expression: 'node.labels["example.com/repair"] == "partner"'
      action: EXTERNAL_REPAIR
```

**Variables.** Each `expression` returns a boolean. It can use:

- `event`: the same event fields as the override rules of [ADR-021](021-health-event-property-overrides.md), and also
  `entitiesImpacted` with the entity attributes.
- `node`: `node.labels` from the Node that fault-remediation reads.

**Evaluation.** At this time, fault-remediation selects the action and then reads the Node for the owner reference of
the CR. The change reads the Node first, then evaluates the rules, then selects the action. This does not add an API
call. fault-remediation has no Node cache ([#1758](https://github.com/NVIDIA/NVSentinel/pull/1758)), so the labels
are current.

| Result | Action |
|---|---|
| A rule with `action` matches | fault-remediation uses that entry of `maintenance.actions` instead of the entry for the recommended action |
| A rule with `disabled: true` matches | No CR. The node state is `remediation-skipped`. The attempt does not count against `maxRemediationAttempts` |
| No rule matches | The action of the event, as at this time |
| A rule cannot be evaluated | No CR. The node state is `remediation-failed`, with the rule name in the message. A metric counts the error for each rule |

A rule that fails stops the evaluation. It does not fall through to the next rule, because a later rule or the
default action can remediate a node that the failed rule excludes. A CEL map lookup of a missing label fails, so a
rule must test for the key first, as `outside-rollout` does.

fault-remediation records the name of the entry that it used, not only the recommended action. It uses that name to
find the CR and its `completeConditionType` later. Thus, a rule change does not lose a CR that is in progress.

**Validation** occurs at startup and as a Helm `fail`:

- Rule names are unique DNS-1123 labels.
- Each `expression` compiles and returns a boolean.
- Each rule has exactly one of `action` and `disabled`.
- Each `action` is a key of `maintenance.actions`.

A new label value, `remediation-skipped`, joins the node state labels. It has the transition
`drain-succeeded → remediation-skipped`.

### Device attributes on health events

`Entity` has only a type and a value. A rule cannot select a GPU model or architecture.

```proto
message Entity {
  string entityType = 1;
  string entityValue = 2;
  // Optional. Well-known keys: "model" (for example "NVIDIA H100 80GB HBM3"),
  // "architecture" (for example "Hopper").
  map<string, string> attributes = 3;
}
```

- metadata-collector already records the NVML device name of each GPU UUID, in both device plugin and DRA modes. It
  adds the architecture, also from NVML.
- The GPU health monitors add `model` and `architecture` to each `GPU_UUID` entity from this
  metadata.
- The Go and Python publishers carry the field. Monitors that do not set it continue to work.
- A rule reads it as `event.entitiesImpacted.exists(e, e.attributes["architecture"] == "Hopper")`.

### The record on the event

```proto
message DrainDecision {
  string method = 1;  // Evict | Custom | Skip
  string scope = 2;   // Node, or the entity type of a partial drain
}

message RemediationDecision {
  string rule = 1;    // rule that matched; empty when no rule matched
  string action = 2;  // entry of maintenance.actions; empty when disabled
  bool disabled = 3;
}

message HealthEventStatus {
  // ... fields 1-7 unchanged ...
  DrainDecision drainDecision = 8;
  RemediationDecision remediationDecision = 9;
}
```

fault-quarantine already records its decision in the cordon-reason label and the quarantine annotation.

[#1950](https://github.com/NVIDIA/NVSentinel/issues/1950) proposes a `NodeHealth` CR that replaces the datastore. If
it is accepted, these two records move to `NodeHealth.status.remediation`. The fields stay the same.

### Phases

Each phase is independent and compatible with earlier versions. Empty configuration gives the current behaviour.

1. fault-quarantine: the fix for [#1439](https://github.com/NVIDIA/NVSentinel/issues/1439).
2. node-drainer: the drain decision and its record, then `skipDrain.nodeSelector`.
3. fault-remediation: `maintenance.rules`, the record, and `remediation-skipped`.
4. Entity attributes and the monitors that set them.

## Changes for a fault in progress

A fault can take hours, from the event to the end of remediation. Node labels and configuration can change during
this time. Each stage decides one time, when it starts, with the current state:

| Stage | Decides | After the decision |
|---|---|---|
| fault-quarantine | When it evaluates the event | Unchanged by a label change. A recovery or a cancel ends it |
| node-drainer | Before the first eviction or custom drain CR | Uses the recorded method until the drain ends |
| fault-remediation | Immediately before it creates the CR | The CR continues. A change does not stop it |

Thus, a label change applies to the stages of a fault that have not started. A change does not undo an action that a
stage already did.

## Rationale

- **Most of the selection exists.** fault-quarantine and node-drainer can already select by node. A shared profile
  adds a second way to configure them.
- **Small changes in the right place.** The gap is in fault-remediation. It already reads the Node immediately before
  it acts, so it can select with current labels at no cost.
- **Known syntax in each component.** fault-remediation uses CEL, as fault-quarantine rules and ADR-021 overrides do,
  because a rule must combine node and event conditions. node-drainer keeps the label selector of
  [#1871](https://github.com/NVIDIA/NVSentinel/pull/1871).
- **Scale.** No new cache for the full cluster. fault-remediation uses its existing Node read. node-drainer adds one
  selector to its informer.

## Consequences

### Positive

- Each component can be changed, released, and reviewed by itself.
- Existing configuration continues to work. Operators add rules only where they need them.
- "Off" is a separate result that the operator can see, for drain and for remediation.
- The drain method no longer changes during a drain.

### Negative

- Each component has its own group definitions. A group that applies to more than one stage is written more than once,
  in two syntaxes.
- No single field shows the full behaviour for a node. The operator reads the cordon-reason label and the two
  records on the event.
- The sequence of the remediation rules controls the result. A rule in the wrong position hides the rules after it.

### Mitigations

- A metric counts the matches for each remediation rule. A rule that another rule hides has a count of zero.
- Document one example per case, with the configuration of each component that it needs.

## Alternatives Considered

### Behaviour profiles (ADR-060)

One shared profile, selected by ordered routes, that enables or disables each stage
([#1952](https://github.com/NVIDIA/NVSentinel/pull/1952)).
**Rejected** because: fault-quarantine and node-drainer can already select by node. A profile adds a shared package,
a schema, and changes to three components, but the drain method, the external repair, and the action for each group
still need changes in each component.

### platform-connectors override rules

Use the override rules of [ADR-021](021-health-event-property-overrides.md) to change `recommendedAction` by node
label.
**Rejected** because: the labels come from a cache that can be 10 minutes old. A rule that fails is skipped, so the
event keeps the action that the rule excluded. The override changes the event for all stages and the node condition,
not only remediation. It also cannot disable remediation, or select a custom action or an external repair.

### `managed=false` or `STORE_ONLY` to disable remediation

**Rejected** because: these stop node conditions and all later stages. `managed=false` shows that a different system
owns the node ([ADR-040](040-external-remediation-request.md)).

### Select the drain method on each pass

The behaviour at this time.
**Rejected** because: a label change during a drain can send later passes to a different method, after a custom
drain CR already exists.

### A CEL expression for `skipDrain`

**Rejected** because: node-drainer selects only by node, and `customDrain.nodeSelector` already uses a label selector.
Two syntaxes in one component are harder to read than one.

## Notes

### Non-goals

- A shared definition of node groups across components.
- Circuit breaker limits for each group. The circuit breaker continues to apply to the full cluster.
- Validation tests and thresholds for each group ([#1922](https://github.com/NVIDIA/NVSentinel/pull/1922)).
- A change to the monitors that run on each node.
- MIG instances in rules.
- A stop of a maintenance CR when a rule change disables remediation.

### Open questions

- **Event overrides and `skipDrain`.** Proposed answer: `drainOverrides.force` on the event has priority over
  `skipDrain.nodeSelector`, as `quarantineOverrides.force` has priority over the rule sets.
- **A `remediation-skipped` node after the event recovers.** Proposed answer: the label is removed when the
  quarantine ends.
- **Attribute sources outside GPUs.** NVSwitch and NIC entities do not have a model source at this time.
